IM-porter
=========

Import IM conversation transcripts to WordPress.

After activating the plugin, visit Tools > Import > Chat Transcripts. Then, you can upload a single transcript or a ZIP of transcripts. It currently only explicitly supports AIM and MSN Messenger transcripts, but give it a shot with anything that's HTML or plain text.

The output may not be perfect. (The output will not be perfect.)  The original raw transcript is saved as post meta so the post can be updated later if you want.
